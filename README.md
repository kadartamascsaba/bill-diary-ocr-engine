# Bill Diary OCR engine

This is a OCR engine which can recognize specific characters from receipt (bill). I used openCV and numpy for segmentation of characters and SVM (libsvm), deep neural nets (theano) for character recognition.

This is my BSc thesis which title is "Information extraction from receipts using machine learning".
